# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

We document significant technical decisions as ADRs. Each ADR includes context, the decision, consequences, alternatives, and open questions. ADRs are immutable; changes create a new ADR that supersedes a prior one.

## Process

1) Propose a change with a draft ADR in `docs/adr/` using the next sequential number.
2) Discuss via PR; obtain at least one reviewer approval.
3) Merge and mark status as `Accepted` (or `Superseded` with link).
